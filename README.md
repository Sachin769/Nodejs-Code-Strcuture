Due to this Scalable Enhanced MVC Code Structure Some Benefits

## Isolated Changes

1. A well-defined folder structure with clear separation of concerns can significantly reduce merge conflicts when multiple developers are working on a project simultaneously.(loose coupling)

2. Each developer can work on specific features or components within their designated folders

## Easier Merging
1. When merging changes, the merge tool can more easily identify and resolve conflicts.
2. Conflicts are often limited to specific files or modules.


## Reduced Risk of Breaking Changes

1. Changes to one part of the code are less likely to have unintended consequences on other parts.


Some Disadvantages 
It always a trade-off between maintainablitiy and peformance.
Some latency time (max. resposne time )of response or project startup may be happened but that is negligble if we concern about maintanibility
