Error.captureStackTrace(this);

A stack trace is like a detailed map of how the code reached a specific point, especially when an error occurs. 
It shows the series of function calls that led up to the error, which helps developers figure out exactly where 
and why something went wrong in the code.
e.g

                                               With Error.captureStackTrace(this);

D:\Sachin\Algocode-Problem-Service\src\index.js:24
    throw new BaseError("Some Error",404,"Something Went Wrong");
    ^
